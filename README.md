# Let's Vacation

Are you an indecisive traveler? Want to use your PTO but don't know where to go? It's common knowledge that vacationing in some
places around the world is more expensive than others. So do you spend 3 days in Zurich? Or a week in Lima?


Let's Vacation is a set of tools and data that provides multiple trip options based on a single user-defined budget. Using price
per night data from Airbnb and Cost of Living data from Numbeo, we are able to estimate the daily cost of traveling in various
cities around the world. This allows us to create vacation options, depending on how frugal or elaborate a traveler 
chooses to be.

This tool was created using Hadoop (version 3.1.2), Apache Spark (version 2.7), and Google Earth Studio.
